# React App Created for Computer Vision Project Report

* The report can be found at https://chiragpatil99.github.io/Soil-Classification-using-Machine-Learning/

* Please refer to the notebooks for detailed code for both the approaches mentioned in the report

* The classification report for each ML model has been printed in the ntbk file <u>Project-Notebooks/ML_Approach_CV_Project.ipynb</u>

* The classification report and confusion matrix for CNN based models are displayed in the ntbk file

* The source code used for filtering augmenting and splitting the dataset has been included in the ntbk file <u>Project-Notebooks/ML_Approach_CV_Project.ipynb</u>

* The Original Dataset as test and train folders, the filtered dataset in the Filtered_Final folder and the final dataset used for both approaches in the       Dataset_Final folder has been uploaded to this shared drive as a zip https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dkEzlTVEbfu_oD4zxkC7wmlYiC-kX84q/view?usp=sharing
